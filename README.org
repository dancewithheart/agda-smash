* Agda Smash

Formal specification of Haskell [[https://hackage.haskell.org/package/smash/][smash]] library in Agda.

From programming point of view provided data types Smash, Wedge and Can can treated as different possiblities
how to combine two types same as: [[https://github.com/agda/agda-stdlib/tree/master/src/Data/Product][Product]], [[https://github.com/agda/agda-stdlib/blob/master/src/Data/Sum/Base.agda][Sum]] and [[https://github.com/agda/agda-stdlib/blob/master/src/Data/These/Base.agda][These]]:

Product, Sum and These show how to combine types in sets, where Smash, Wedge and Can do the same for pointed ses:

#+BEGIN: columnview"
| description         | sets    | algebra in sets  | pointed sets  | algebra in pointed sets |
|---------------------+---------|------------------|---------------|-------------------------|
| both                | Product | A * B            | Smash product | 1 + (A * B)             |
| on of them          | Sum     | A + B            | Wedge sum     | 1 + A + B               |
| both or one of them | These   | A + B + (A * B)  | Can           | 1 + A + B + (A * B)     |
#+END:

[[https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/smash+product][Smash product]] is canonical tensor product of pointed sets in a category, given by taking product of underlying objects and indentifying with new basepoint - basepoints from ingredients.

#+BEGIN_SRC agda
data Smash (A : Set) (B : Set) : Set where
  nada  :           Smash A B
  smash : A -> B -> Smash A B
#+END_SRC


[[https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/wedge+sum][Wedge sum]] of two pointed sets A and B
is the quotient set of the disjoint union A + B where both copies of the basepoint are identified.

#+BEGIN_SRC agda
data Wedge (A : Set)(B : Set) : Set where
  nowhere :           Wedge A B
  here    : A ->      Wedge A B
  there   :      B -> Wedge A B
#+END_SRC

Can combines smash product with wedge sum:


#+BEGIN_SRC agda
data Can (A : Set)(B : Set) : Set where
  non : Can A B
  one : A      -> Can A B
  eno :      B -> Can A B
  two : A -> B -> Can A B
