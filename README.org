* Agda Smash

Translation of Haskell library [[https://hackage.haskell.org/package/smash/][smash]] into Agda.

[[https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/smash+product][Smash product]] is canonical tensor product of pointed sets in a category, vien by taking product of underlying objects and indentifying with new basepoint - basepoints from ingredients.
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
nada ----+---- smash A B
#+END_EXAMPLE

[[https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/wedge+sum][Wedge sum]] of two pointed sets A and B
is the quotient set of the disjoint union A + B where both copies of the basepoint are identified.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
         here A

            |
nowhere ----+
            |

          there B
