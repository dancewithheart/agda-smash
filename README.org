* Agda Smash

Translation of Haskell library [[https://hackage.haskell.org/package/smash/][smash]] into Agda.

[[https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/smash+product][Smash product]] of `pointed objects` in category of Agda types and functions.

Pointed set A is represented as `Maybe A`.

Smash

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
nada ----+ smash A B
#+END_EXAMPLE

[[https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/wedge+sum][Wedge sum]] of two pointed sets A and B
is the quotient set of the disjoint union A + B where both copies of the basepoint are identified.

Wedge sum:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
         here A
            |
            |
nowhere ----+
            |
            |
          there B
#+END_EXAMPLE

Can

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
      one A
        |
        |
Non ----+----- two A B
        |
        |
      eno B
#+END_EXAMPLE
